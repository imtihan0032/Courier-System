J&T Express celebrates another milestone with Fotion Motor Philippines, Inc. (FMPI) after its successful turnover ceremony on May 7. The strengthened fleet is expected to address the growing demand for logistics across the country.

"It all started more than two years ago when both of our companies partnered together to provide stronger logistics mobility service to adapt with the ever-growing demands of delivery and the booming success of e-commerce," says Foton Motor Philippines, Inc. (FMPI) President, Rommel Sytin.

Started by the initial turnover of 60 units of Foton Tornado 2E E4 F-Vans, J&T Express has developed its trust in Foton, leading to further close collaboration and solidifying the partnership. Going through highs and lows, both companies have successfully staved off challenges to achieve greater heights.

To date, J&T Express has acquired fleets of Foton commercial vehicles ranging from Gratour Series (GS) to Light Duty Trucks (LDT), up to the Heavy Duty Trucks (HDT). Most of these units are Tornado M 4.2C under the LDT category.

Embodying versatility combined with proven dependability, the Foton Tornado M 4.2C has empowered businesses from big corporations to small and medium businesses. Powered by an internationally recognized 3.8L ISF Cummins engine, it produces a maximum power output of 154hp at 2,600 rpm and 500Nm pf torque from 1,200 to 1900 rpm-offering solid strength for delivering products across cities.

"It is important to forge a partnership with a fleet provider that provides us quality units with the latest advancement in technology and reliable 24/7 customer service support. Indeed, Foton has been consistent with their promise," says Vice President of J&T Express PH, Zoe Chi.

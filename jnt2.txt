Therefore, it’s safe to say that the hot issues have taken a huge toll on a lot of people, and as a result, most of them opted to switch to other delivery services instead.

The case is apparent as seen in this TikTok clip, posted by Twitter user @CahayaSakinah_, featuring a J&T staff showing his delivery truck, which now only carries a few boxes of goods. As stated in the video, the delivery men would usually deliver up to 100 to 150 parcels per day. However, after the issues went viral, they only deliver about 20 to 30 items to shoppers.

The replies section has been flooded with mixed reactions left by netizens on Twitter.  @JalalMisai_2 expressed, “The issue involving J&T the other day proved that consumer power is functioning well and it also gave a strong reminder to similar competing businesses. Improve and increase your quality. Maximise customers’ satisfaction again. It’s not impossible to get back on track, as long as there are improvements.”

Another Twitter user @imran_ajmaiin left a negative remark, saying, “They broke our trust. What can they expect from that? Many suffered losses because their parcels were either lost or damaged. My family lost RM3k because of the smashed parcels. Just imagine, even a hard tupperware could also break?”

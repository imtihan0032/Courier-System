With the reinitiation of MCO, most of us are back indoors with few reasons to go out. But there are times when you just need to buy stuff, which is why e-commerce and deliveries have become a norm. On that topic, Pos Malaysia is tweaking how its deliveries work.

Normally, Pos Laju requires you to provide your IC number when you receive your deliveries. That's no longer the case now that the company has introduced a new verification system. Specifically, recipients will now get a 6-digit code sent to their phone via SMS, which you will need to provide upon receiving your package.

As you can probably tell, this allows for actual contactless deliveries by Pos Laju. You can have the postman maintain a distance from you, give them the 6-digit code, then collect the package once they've verified and departed from your premise. So do keep an eye for that SMS if you're expecting a Pos Laju delivery.

With that said, what do you think about the new system? Is it a relevant improvement or change for you? Let us know in the comments and stay tuned to TechNave for more news like this.

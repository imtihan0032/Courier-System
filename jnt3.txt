PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) has demanded an explanation from a courier service provider over the actions of its staff that was captured in a video clip that went viral on social media recently.

MCMC said it had issued a warning letter to the management of the company ordering it to better manage staff’s conduct.

“MCMC reminds all licenced courier service providers to always mind the Postal Services Act 2021, especially when it comes to protecting customers’ rights,” the agency said in a statement today.

It also reminded licenced couriers that any violation of the act will see the management being penalised with a RM300,000 fine, three years’ jail, or both.

MCMC urged Malaysians to understand their rights as consumers before choosing any courier service for the delivery of their purchases.

“Consumers should always reach out to service providers should they find their goods damaged during delivery.

“Users dissatisfied with the offered solution can also submit a report to MCMC for further investigation,” it said.

On Feb 8, it was reported that J&T Express Perak had issued a statement over a viral video showing its employees mishandling customers’ packages.

The company said the incident was not due to alleged pay cut as claimed in the video that had gone viral, but that it was over a misunderstanding on bonus payments.

The workers involved later confirmed this in an apology video posted on J&T Express Perak’s Facebook page.

“We want to apologise and want to state that there are no internal issues or wage deductions between the company and employees of J&T Express Perak,” they said.
